Virtual Octopus Web Server, V-Octopus is an open-source Web Server to be developed during CSC867 classes at SFSU, supporting to Http/1.1 protocol.

"Octopuses are highly intelligent, probably more intelligent than any other order of invertebrates. The exact extent of their intelligence and learning capability is much debated among biologists, but maze and problem-solving experiments have shown that they do have both short- and long-term memory... In laboratory experiments, octopuses can be readily trained to distinguish between different shapes and patterns." http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octopus

This kernel of this web server will be based on the features of an octopus, where its short- and long-memory capabilities are the Session and Persistent ones from a regular web server. Furthermore, this server will be able to distinguish between different request types from the regular HTTP usage to the implementation of REST, similar to the capability to distinguish between shares. I gave this name because I like the ocean and its amazing creatures. Future work include the use of Web Services APIs for SOA, using Enterprise Service Bus.

It will be based on core JAVA technologies, concurrent API usage from Java 5/6. Furthermore, it will be completely written from scratch following W3 HTTP1.1 specifications.

# Code

This set of files is designed to get you started on your web server project from SFSU, 2008 class.
It contains classes and functions that can be used to implement your server. Please note you are
not required to use these classes if you would prefer to implement the assignment differently.
You will still be required to design and implement the server using these classes and functions
as we have not included any variable names and very few private functions (e.g. accessor functions).

We have also included a set of sample configuration files and helper classes that you can use as well.

Questions are more than welcome and we will be happy to help you with your project.

Good Luck! :)
